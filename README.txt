Project Title: Preparing the National Child Development Study genetic data for imputation

Project description: The NCDS is a long running British birth cohort study, and genetic information is available 
for a subsample of the participants. Genetic data collection occured on multiple arrays. This repository
documents the quality control process that was undertaken on seven NCDS arrays. The preparation process described
here was carried out before uploading the genetic datasets to the Michigan Imputation Server.

Instructions: The complete imputed data will be made available by the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at 
University College London, making the primary purpose of this GitHub repository informational.
Preparation for each array is broken down into four steps, listed in numerical order. Each file contains
the requirements for the code within, should you wish to recreate this process yourself. The scripts should
be run in a unix environment.
