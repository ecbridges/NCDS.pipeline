#This is the second step for the Illumina 15k array preparation.
#This step updates the genome build to GRCh37. In order to do this, follow the instructions at
https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~wrayner/strand/ for the update_build.pl script.
#For this array, the update process must be carried out twice. The first time, update to GRCh36. Then,
#update the GRCh36 file to GRCh37.
#For the Illumina 15k array, a custom file is required. See the webpage above for information on requesting custom files. 
# Name the new, updated GRCh37 file illumina.15.QC4
